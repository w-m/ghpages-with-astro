  title: Mnemonics Training - Multi-Class Incremental Learning without Forgetting
  authors: "**Yaoyao Liu**, Yuting Su, An-An Liu, Bernt Schiele, Qianru Sun"
  venue: IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition **(CVPR)**, 2020
  description: This work presents a novel incremental learning approach that maintains exemplars in the feature space rather than pixel space, enabling more efficient use of memory for learning new tasks.

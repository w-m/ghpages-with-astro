#   authors: "**Yaoyao Liu**, Yuting Su, An-An Liu, Bernt Schiele, Qianru Sun"
#   venue: IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition **(CVPR)**, 2020
#   description: This work presents a novel incremental learning approach that maintains exemplars in the feature space rather than pixel space, enabling more efficient use of memory for learning new tasks.

#   title: Using Keyframe Selection to Improve Detection of Primate Faces in Videos
#   authors: "**Wieland Morgenstern**"
#   venue: Master's Thesis
#   description: Poses of primates in video frames and their image quality are determined through image processing and machine learning. Frames with the highest quality and best pose are selected for further processing. Recognition of individuals was vastly improved. I worked on this topic for my master's thesis to improve the detection rate of the **SAISBECO** project - Semi-Automated Audiovisual Species and Individual Identification System for Behavioral Ecological Research and Conservation.

  authors: ""
  venue: Personal Project
  description: Exploring the colors of moving pictures. I'm fascinated with colors in moving pictures, and started this project to visualize the colors and their change over time in films. It's quite hard to boil down all the information just one movie contains into a single image, but fun to play around with different and unique plots.

#   description: Objective-C Generics - checking type correctness at compile time for NSArray, NSDictionary and NSSet. The language Objective-C doesn't provide generics. Heavily disputed whether they are needed in Objective-C, yet often used in comparable languages. WMGenericCollection provides generics for Objective-C through custom collection subclasses, which can be created with C Macros.
